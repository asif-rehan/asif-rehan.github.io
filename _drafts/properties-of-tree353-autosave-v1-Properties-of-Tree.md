Quoting from Dasgupta, Papadimitrou, and Vazirani textbook:

> “Trees A tree is an **undirected** graph that is **connected** and **acyclic**.”
> 
> <cite>p.135</cite>

Trees have these properties, quoting from DPV again:

1. A tree on **n nodes has n − 1 edge**s
2. Any **connected, undirected** graph G = (V, E) with **|E| = |V| − 1 is a tree**.
3. An **undirected** graph is a tree if and only if there is a **unique path between any pair of nodes**.
