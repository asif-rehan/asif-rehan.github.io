Hi, this is Asif Rehan.

I currently work as a Lead Data Scientist building a Recommender System at the [Ford Motor Company.](https://www.ford.com/) Earlier, I used to work at a mobility startup, [Metropia Inc.](http://metropia.com/metropia-driving-better-city) as a Research Engineer covering a range of roles from research, data analysis, real-time prediction engine, backend development and system administration. Due to my experience at the startup, I am very passionate about building new analytics-driven software tools for mobility and transportation problems.

I am very fortunate to have worked with [Dr. Karthik Konduriâ€™s lab](http://karthikkonduri.weebly.com/) at UConn where I built a [prototype system to estimate route travel time](https://opencommons.uconn.edu/gs_theses/807/) and implemented some interesting Machine Learning algorithms.

I have a MS in Computer Science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) and another MS in Transportation Engineering from the [UConn.](https://uconn.edu/)

I enjoy listening to diverse types of music. Lately I am leaning towards EDM and electronic, but I have interests in heavy metal, classical, jazz and industrial rock. You can see my Spotify profile link at the top of this page.
