Hi, this is Asif Rehan.

I create software at Ford Pro. Earlier, I used to work at a mobility startup, Metropia Inc. as a Research Engineer covering a range of roles from research, data analysis, real-time prediction engine, backend development and system administration. Due to my experience at the startup, I am very passionate about building new analytics-driven software tools for mobility and transportation problems.

I am very fortunate to have worked with Dr. Karthik Konduriâ€™s lab at UConn where I built a prototype system to estimate route travel time and implemented some interesting Machine Learning algorithms.

I have a MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech and another MS in Transportation Engineering from the UConn.
