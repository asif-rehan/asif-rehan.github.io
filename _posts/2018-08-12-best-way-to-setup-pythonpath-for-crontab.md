There are many suggestions on this.

Add PYTHONPATH at the end of the ~/.bash\_profile or ~/.bash\_login files. If they do not exist, add it to ~/.bash\_profile as suggested by [this StackOverflow post](https://web.archive.org/web/20170607032258/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3402168/permanently-add-a-directory-to-pythonpath).

```
<span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, monospace;">export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/home/path/to/your/python/package/"</span>
```

But this will add the package to the current userâ€™s PYTHONPATH. To ensure crontab gets it right away. add this line to the top of crontab file, BEFORE crontab tries to execute any script of that package

```
PYTHONPATH/home/path/to/your/python/package
```
