This morning, while I was driving my wife to Marshalls store, the Canadian radio channel across the river, was playing. Suddenly the RJ started describing the exciting news about the upcoming Avatar sequels, with a great enthusiasm. James Cameron, the famous movie director has been working on his future projects of Avatar sequels and over the next few years, 2021, 2022, up until 2028 which sequels will be released.

That got me thinking. No, I was not distracted at all, I was still driving with full attention to the surrounding. But is not it amazing that there is a huge thing cooking up somewhere in the world and we only know that it will be shown to people far in the future. Is this how RJ Scaringe got the funding to run his stealth startup, Rivian, completely under the radar for years?

What does it take for the leader like James Cameron and RJ Scaringe or some other entrepreneurial person to manage money, people, investment, resources, and so many other aspects to make big dreams come to reality? Why do people trust their vision? Why do people sign up thinking the cause is worth their effort? Because I believe when a movie like Avatar is being produced, or a startup is developing a product before actual launch, there are motivated animators, artists, engineers who are not just working for the paycheck, they had the passion and motivation to delve into a journey of building something unique. What vision a leader or entrepreneur present that such people come on-board? Obviously the argument can be made that the entrepreneur has to only convince the financier to finance the project and that drives it all. But dreaming something unique and big and then convincing a whole bunch of people to pitch in is more than just money. When people truly believe in an interesting vision, they actually participate in making it true, instead of just accompanying reluctantly.   
  
I believe, this is the the whole new role in the AI-driven future of the most efficient thinking machine, the humans. Can we formalize the dreaming, ideation, and convincing process to train entrepreneurs?
