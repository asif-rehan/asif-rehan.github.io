This is the recommended template for a Project Proposal for a freelance Machine Learning project. This is my personal choice, and definitely depending on project requirements, you might need to explicitly modify change/modify/add to this list. One size does not always fit all for Machine Learning projects. But anyway this could be a good starting point.

## Steps for a Machine Learning Project

I propose these steps below.

1. **Data Exploration:** I will explore the data features, target variables and get an understanding of how they are related
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** I will draw correlation plots, and find ranges, outliers from the data and do Exploratory Data Analysis
3. **Feature Selection/Engineering:** I will identify, select/generate features for the models
4. **Cross Validation, Hyper Parameter Tuning, and Building Models:**  I will run cross-validation technique to search for best hyperparameters for each models
5. **Model Selection, Performance Evaluation, and Delivery:** I will provide charts for each modelâ€™s performance graphically and deliver the code and report.

## **Milestones and Deliverables**

I would also recommend you split the Machine Learning project deliverables in 3 milestones.

**First Milestone:**  Step 1,2,3 above.   
**Second Milestone:** Step 4  
**Third Milestone:** Step 5
